# Interview Algorithm Lab üß™

Welcome to the **Interview Algorithm Lab**! This repository is a focused collection of classic computer science algorithms, implemented in C#. It's designed to be a practical resource for interview preparation, learning, and practice.

Whether you're brushing up for a technical interview, studying data structures and algorithms, or just curious, this lab provides clear, well-documented, and easy-to-understand implementations.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Clear Implementations**: Each algorithm is implemented in C# with a focus on readability and correctness.
-   **Detailed Explanations**: Every algorithm includes a `README.md` file that explains its logic, time/space complexity, and a real-world analogy.
-   **Interactive Demo**: A console application is included to run each algorithm and see it in action, step-by-step.

## üìö Algorithms & Data Structures Included

This repository contains a collection of fundamental searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, and data structures.

### üîç Searching Algorithms

-   **[Binary Search](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/Searching/BinarySearch)**: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a **sorted** list of items.
-   **[Linear Search](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/Searching/LinearSearch)**: A simple method that sequentially checks each element of a list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

### üß© Sorting Algorithms

-   **[Bubble Sort](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/Sorting/BubbleSort)**: A straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
-   **[Insertion Sort](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/Sorting/InsertionSort)**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
-   **[Merge Sort](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/Sorting/MergeSort)**: A highly efficient, stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm using a divide and conquer strategy.
-   **[Quick Sort](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/Sorting/QuickSort)**: An efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer approach. It is often faster in practice than other $O(n \log n)$ algorithms.

### üèóÔ∏è Data Structures

-   **[HashTable](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/DataStructures/HashTable)**: A data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup, implementing an associative array.
-   **[LinkedList](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/DataStructures/LinkedList)**: A linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.
-   **[Queue](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/DataStructures/Queue)**: A linear structure which follows a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.
-   **[Stack](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/DataStructures/Stack)**: A linear structure which follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.

## üöÄ Interactive Demo Application

The `Algorithms.Demo` project makes it easy to visualize and understand how these algorithms work.

### How it Works

The console application provides a simple menu to:
1.  **Choose an algorithm** to execute (e.g., Bubble Sort, Binary Search).
2.  **Select your input**:
    * Enter a comma-separated list of numbers.
    * Generate a random array of a specified size.
3.  **See the output**: The application will print the step-by-step execution of the chosen algorithm, showing comparisons, swaps, and the state of the array at each stage.
