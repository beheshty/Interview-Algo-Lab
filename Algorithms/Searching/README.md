# Searching Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various searching algorithms. Below is a summary and comparison of their time and space complexities.

Each algorithm has its own directory containing a detailed `README.md` with a step-by-step explanation and implementation details.

### Complexity Comparison

| Algorithm                                                  | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity | Notes                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [Linear Search](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/Searching/LinearSearch)       | O(1)        | O(n)         | O(1)  | Works on unsorted arrays.        |
| [Binary Search](https://github.com/beheshty/Interview-Algo-Lab/tree/master/Algorithms/Searching/BinarySearch)        | O(1)         | O(log n)      | O(1)   | Requires the array to be sorted. |
